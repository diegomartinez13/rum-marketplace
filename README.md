# rum-marketplace
This project aims to provide a marketplace where the UPRM community can buy and sell products of their interest. We want to provide a way to sell and buy books, art, jewelry, second-hand clothing, and more, with an indirect intention of promoting the second-use-live of many unwanted belongings.
